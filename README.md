# ROLL-A-BALL - MY FIRST VIDEO-GAME MADE IN UNITY

Roll a ball is an entertaining videogame wich main goal is to collect yellow cubes as much as possible, trying to avoid the red ones.
In case you hit a red cube, one point will be decreased in the score.
As soon as one of the type of cubes went gone, the videogame will be over. Wining, the colour with higher score.

Engine: Unity
